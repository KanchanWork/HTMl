        <h2>What is Figma? </h2>
        Figma is a powerful design tool that helps you to create anything: websites, applications, logos, and much more.
        By learning to use Figma, you'll take your first steps into User Interface Design and and User Experience Design. 
        These skills are essential for building a great portfolio for yourself and potentially for your own company.
        How to Make a Frame in Figma
        First we will create a frame. This is the same as a page, and it's where our design will live. You can size a frame however you want depending on your requirements.
        
        This example will be a website, so we will select the Desktop Frame â€“ but you can also create mobile application frames, or even custom frames.
        
        Select the Frame tool from the top menu
        Select the Frame size on the right panel
        
        <h2>How to Add Grids and Columns in Figma</h2>
        Before we start with the design, you will want to add grids that help you keep the alignment of content for your page consistent.
        
        You can add grids to a frame and customise them. For example, I often prefer 12 grids as this is the default for website development.
        
        Select the frame you wish to grid
        Select Layout Grid on the right panel
        Select Columns and 12 units
        
        <h2>How to Use Shapes in Figma</h2>
        Use the shapes and elements in Figma to create squares, circles, lines, and more. These are the fundamentals for creating a design on a page.
        
        Select Square Shape tool
        Create a square
        Begin to shape and size it
        
        <h2>How to Add Images in Figma</h2>
        You can add images from an online source or locally to your page. Images are an important part of designing a website, especially for the hero section.
        
        Let's add a logo as our first image which we will add to the top left of the screen.
        
        Drag and drop an image from you local computer
        Import an image from the shapes image upload option
        Resize and place the image on the design

        <h2>How to Add Text to a Design in Figma</h2>
        To add text to a design, select the text tool and place it on the page. The font will default to Roboto, but you can change the font family, size, and color at any stage.
        
        In this example we will use right panel to change the color and size of the font, and later the font family as well.
        
        Select the Text tool
        Add "About" text as the start of the navigation
        Ensure the size and color are 24 and white

        <h2>How to Label Elements and Create Groups in Figma</h2>
        Working with lots of layers in Figma can get confusing, so label all your elements as soon as you create them. Even better is to group different sections and shapes with labels such as "Hero Background" or "Navbar".
        
        Select your element/s and right click to group or press Ctrl + G
        Name your group
        Places groups inside groups for each section of your page to improve readability once your page gets large
